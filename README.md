# Skin-Cancer-Detection

Overview

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to detect skin cancer from images. The model classifies images of skin lesions as either benign or malignant, helping in early detection and treatment of skin cancer.
Features

    Image preprocessing and augmentation
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification
    Training and evaluation scripts
    User interface for uploading and predicting skin cancer from images
